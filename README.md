AIJ Testing
===========

This repository contains a [test plan](./TestPlan.md) and associated 
resources for a basic system test or "smoke test" of an AstroImageJ
release candidate. The test plan can also serve as a terse introduction
to doing a transit analysis with AstroImageJ.

----------------

The test plan author (Brian Hill) would like to acknowledge that the
plan substantially follows the sequence of operations taught by
by Dennis Conti in his AAVSO CHOICE Course: [Exoplanet
Observing](https://www.aavso.org/exoplanet-observing-choice-course).

The images in `resources/data_processor` are a portion of the transit data taken and
analyzed with Ariana Hofelmann, and
[jointly presented](http://physics.stmarys-ca.edu/observatory/resources/SteppingStones-AAVSO-2018-11-16.pdf)
along with other transit data, at the November 16, 2018 meeting of the AAVSO.

The images in `resources/test_fits_reader` were supplied by Karen Collins from
her work with Las Cumbres Observatory and the TESS mission.
